# LemonLens.ai - Vehicle Health Report Application

## Overview

LemonLens.ai is a full-stack web application that allows users to generate and track vehicle health reports using real-world complaint data. The application provides insights into potential issues and maintenance recommendations for vehicles.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

### Frontend
- **React**: Single-page application built with React for the client-side UI
- **ShadCN UI**: Component library using Radix UI primitives for consistent design
- **TailwindCSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for styling
- **React Query**: For data fetching, caching, and state management
- **React Hook Form with Zod**: Form handling with schema validation

### Backend
- **Express.js**: Node.js web framework for the API server
- **Drizzle ORM**: Database ORM for PostgreSQL
- **PostgreSQL**: Relational database (setup in replit modules)

### Authentication
- Session-based authentication with custom user management
- Support for anonymous sessions with data persistence

## Key Components

### Frontend Components
1. **AuthContext**: Manages user authentication state throughout the application
2. **UI Components**: Extensive set of reusable UI components built with ShadCN
3. **Report Generation Flow**: Form-based workflow for creating vehicle health reports
4. **Reports Dashboard**: View and manage previously generated reports

### Backend Components
1. **API Routes**: RESTful endpoints for user management, report generation, and vehicle data
2. **Database Layer**: Drizzle ORM for type-safe database access
3. **Storage Interface**: Abstraction for data persistence (with memory storage implementation)
4. **External API Integration**: For fetching vehicle data from third-party sources

## Data Flow

1. **User Authentication**:
   - Users can register, login, or use the application anonymously
   - Session data persists in database for authenticated users or local storage for anonymous users

2. **Report Generation**:
   - User selects vehicle make, model, year, and other details
   - Backend processes the request and generates a health report
   - Reports are persisted in the database

3. **Report Management**:
   - Users can view their report history
   - Reports can be retried if processing fails

## Database Schema

The database schema includes:
- **users**: User accounts with authentication information
- **sessions**: For managing user sessions
- **vehicle_makes**: Vehicle manufacturer data
- **vehicle_models**: Vehicle model data linked to makes
- **vehicle_years**: Year data for specific models
- **reports**: Vehicle health reports generated by users

## External Dependencies

- **@tanstack/react-query**: For data fetching and state management
- **@radix-ui**: For accessible UI components
- **@neondatabase/serverless**: For PostgreSQL database connectivity
- **drizzle-orm**: For database ORM
- **zod**: For data validation
- **axios**: For HTTP requests to external APIs

## Deployment Strategy

The application is configured for deployment on Replit with:
- **Build process**: Using Vite for the frontend and esbuild for the backend
- **Database**: PostgreSQL from Replit modules
- **Environment**: Node.js 20 runtime
- **Autoscaling**: Configured for production deployment

When deployed, the application runs on port 5000 with automatic provisioning of the required infrastructure through Replit modules.
